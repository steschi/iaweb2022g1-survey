Web graphics are a way to include visual scenes on websites or web applications.
While static images can be easily included to an existing site by using the HTML image tag,
interactivity is often a crucially important feature needed to bring ideas or scenes to life.
It can have a positive impact on overall site engagement \parencite{web-engagement-literature}.
Interactivity can be a very broad term to define, but it includes anything a user can do within
a graphic to manipulate the scene. The traditional two-dimensional ways of including interactive
web graphics ot a website are SVG and Canvas2D.
SVG is a declarative specification, similar to HTML or XML, producing crisp vector art with
limited options of interactivity through hover and transformation events.
Canvas2D is an imperative way of rendering to a scene by using JavaScript. TODO EXTEND?

For more complex two-dimensional, or three-dimensional scenes, the capabilities of the GPU can be utilized
through the means of WebGL or WebGPU.
